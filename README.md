# Surveillance_camera

##Overview
The main aim of the project is archiving data captured from surveillances cameras mounted in laboratory classes.

##Description
First step in this project was to capture screenshots from IP cameras. If you log in successfully, they are saved in "\Screenshots\<IP>" at a fixed time in "file_config_archiving_interval.txt" and also deleted after a fixed time in the same file. There is a possibility to change the position of IP cameras by using proper presets. It works on Windows and Linux.
